# 3DSBank
Have you hit the 300 title limit on your 3DS, and/or want more than 300 titles, but don't want to make an EmuNAND (or 2nd one), or use another SD card?

The answer, is 3DSBank!

With this, you can store your `Nintendo 3DS` folder into a bank, and select or create another one to use, containing your other titles (and themes, and badges).

# Adding custom names
The custom names can be defined in 3DSBank/3DSBank.ini like so:
```
[3DSBANK]
SLOT_NAME_0 = Favorites
SLOT_NAME_1 = More Fav.
SLOT_NAME_2 = Homebrew Games
```
etc....
